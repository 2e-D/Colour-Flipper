# Colour-Flipper
The colour flipper is now fully complete. I wish i could of done it with little to no tutorial help but programming involves alot of looking up issues on google so i shouldn't feel to bad.

If anything it tells me i still have alot to learn and work on with Javascript


To see the final project, Check out my GitHub Pages link : https://2e-d.github.io/Colour-Flipper. 

What I learnt during this project 
° Basic DOM manipulation 
° Pulling random items from an array 
° JavaScript Functions
